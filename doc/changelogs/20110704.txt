Here is a pretty exhaustive list of what the BIG MERGE includes:

- upgrade the list of gems: Rails 3.0.9, Devise 1.3.4, Rake 0.9.2, ...etc
- roles with the CanCan gem
  note: 3 kind of roles. Administrator (they can do everything), Designer (like Administrator but applied on a single website), Author (only edit pages and contents)
- resizing images on the fly (ticket #79)
- tinyMCE enhancements (ticket #99):
  - the locomotive image plugin has been replaced by the locomotive media plugin which allows you to upload any kind of files
  - fullscreen mode, very convenient to edit a long text
- remove asset_collections:
  note: the asset collections tab was confusing for users (and me too). Actually, it's like a content type with a different kind of view in the back-office (the galery view is not implemented yet)
- use dashes instead of underscores (ticket #56)
  note: pages (slug) and contents (permalink) uses the parameterize String method.
- SEO (tickets #57 & #90)
  - index and index/ are the same page now (301 redirection)
  - add a seo_title for both the site, the page and content objects.
  - write a {% seo %} liquid tag to display the title, meta (description and keywords) tags depending on the context
- fix issue about httparty (ticket #91)
- check if custom contents are organized in a category when displaying the select box for the has_one / has_many fields
- add 2 liquid global variables in the page conext: current time and date. Dates from a custom content are now comparable
- site export (but editable_elements inside a page are not correctly handled for now)
- rake task to import a remote template
- UI tweaks, a quick list of some of them
  - better hints for the theme asset new/edit action
  - slight modifications on forms: separator between fields, text shadow, error message redesigned, ...etc
  - quick link to edit directly a model from the submenu
- new sites picker (if the multi_sites mode is enabled and correctly set up)
- the robots.txt can be edited directly from the back-office (site settings) (ticket #57)
- 2 new languages:
  - dutch (#92)
  - spanish (#103)
- a lot of internal refactoring as well as a ton of bug corrections
